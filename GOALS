GOALS

1. Implement "networked game code" so I can see the network protocol library from the user POV

2. Develop a demo framework that allows me to easily explore OpenGL programming and VR
   without needing to write new demo programs each time I want to try something out

3. Use this framework to implement various demos for my GDC 2014 talk, eg. visualizations

4. Bring back virtual go functionality within this framework and implement virtual go client/server
