GOALS

1. Develop a demo framework that allows me to easily explore OpenGL programming and VR
   without needing to write new demo programs each time I want to try something out

2. Use this framework to implement various demos for my GDC 2014 talk, eg. visualizations

3. Use this framework to implement "networked game code" for virtual go so I can see the 
   network protocol library from the user POV

4. Use this framework to develop "Virtual Go" client and server in VR
