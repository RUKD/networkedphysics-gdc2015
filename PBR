Notes

The disney model has two colors: diffuse and specular, and it interpolates between them first with the metalness, and then uses that for shading.

The other model, sebastian legrand, has diffuse and specular calculated separately so it blends between between the two, eg. separate specular and diffuse contributions blended, vs. blending the color first.

Seems the second model would be better for what I want to do.

The cubemap as an input must be HDR because with diffuse reflections, this is how the highlights show through

Linear space should be used for framebuffer and textures.

The roughness in the shader is exponentiated, but input from designers is [0,1]

Everything is [0,1] externally.

Normalization factor just ensures that the direct specular, eg. analytical specular lobe, normalizes out to less bright as it becomes more diffuse. It does *not* mix specular and diffuse so they are perfectly energy conserving.

Can import cross textures from debevec into modified cubemapgen without having hdrshop installed.

Diffuse cubemap is typically a lower res cubemap, eg. 8x8 cubemap, very blurred.

Can create better, more accurate cubemap for my purposes by having a skybox, and the board, and then sampling within that to generate another cubemap which is then run through modified cubemapgen to get the indirect specular cubemap (blurred)

Is possible to blend between multiple cubemaps, if you do it right, eg. consider the eye position relative to the cubemap, and blend between cubemaps while avoiding swimming. But I probably wont need to do this for my scene!
