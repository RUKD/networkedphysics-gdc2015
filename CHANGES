    Need a way to resolve DNS into addresses.

    Add a new interface "Resolver". 

    Derive from this and create a new "DNSResolver"

    This will keep it generic, for example I could create redis
    based server resolver for giving game instances server names,
    or a master server list etc.

    By having a resolver interface I won't care how the name -> address
    resolution occurs, just that it *does* occur.

    Added way to initialize address from addrinfo ptr (from resolve DNS...)

    Cache data on lookup so it can be queried.

    If an address has already been looked up, don't fire off a new async for it.
    (but must you call the callback?! not sure... probably.)

    There should have the option to clear the cache.

    There should be a way to look up an address without calling lambda.

    Optimize DNS resolver so that in-progress queries are in a separate hash,
    so we don't go O(n) in the udptae after lots of queries have been done.

    Verify that multiple overlapping resolve calls work, and all the lambdas are called on completion

    Verify resolve failure works as well, and cached fail result.

    Basic serialization, serialize_int etc.

    Base object for serialization with virtual Serialize( Stream & stream ) method.

    Back packet class with serialize, address string (eg. sent from), and type int.

    Factory class to create packets from type.

    If you try to create an object of a type that is not registered, throw a runtime_error.

    Explore "getaddrinfo" for IPv6 aware hostname -> IP address etc.

    Implement basic address class capable of handling IPv6 and IPv6

    Implement function to convert IPv4 string to address int + port

    Verify IPv4 UDP broadcast address is converted properly: 0xffffffff

    Implement function to convert IPv4 address + port back to string
    (Omit the port if it is zero).

    Added code to initialize IPv6 with 16bit pairs, including htons
    (decided on network byte order for internal address data...)

    Handle port number in IPv6 output string, eg. "[v6addr]:portnum"

    Implement IPv6 parse from string

    Implement IPv6 parse from string with port, eg. "[addr6]:portnum"
