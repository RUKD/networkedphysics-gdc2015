    Implement relative orientation

    Can relative orientation be efficient?

    How to encode it?

    Axis-angle?

    I'm thinking the big win here is axis-angle where the axis is the same between current and base.

    Is there still benefit if the axis changes by a small amount?

    I think yes.

    Do the axis the same angle change only and see how many are picked up by it.

    Next, do the short range axis change + angle change.

    Cannot expect to pick up everything, but make sure the small rotations are!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Simplify existing serialization code. It's getting a bit complex!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement relative indices on top of all other optimizations

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Need some sort of bandwidth statistics split up into position, orientation, indices etc.
