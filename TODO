TODO:

    Add the concept of current cursor position left/right within the buffer

    When you insert text with the cursor position not at end, shift the text to the right
    before inserting the new character.

    When deleting text, do it at the cursor position, delete one char to the left of cursor,
    and shift left any remaining text at or right of the cursor position left.

    ------------------

    Make the cursor blink

    ------------------

    Fix issue with the vertex buffers affecting each other.

    ------------------

    Implement two modes of console:

        1. Quick entry mode, ~, type in command and then enter to execute. esc or ~ cancels

        2. Full console mode -- black alpha quad, text history of command execution (double ~~ or alt-~)

    ------------------

    Need to do something so text is the same size between retina (windowed) and non-retina display (fullscreen)

    ------------------

    Determine size of the console (height) in characters. 

    Determine # of characters wide depending on screen resolution.

    Implement a data structure for the console, eg. # of lines. Each line
    is an array of text up to 1024 chars wide?

    It's a ring buffer. Text is initially just set to "" per-line

    Empty lines mean don't render anything (Eg. skip, entirely, no newline even...)

    Per-line should note if it's an error or a message or a command (red/white/blue)

    Dummy up some console text and render it.

    ------------------

    Implement console text buffer.

    Implement pageup pagedown within this buffer somehow (scroll events?)

    Implement scrolling in this console buffer, eg. page-up page-down, ctrl-up, ctrl-down,
    command-up, command-down.

    ------------------

    Implement console commands on client

    Implement quit console command, connect console command and disconnect.

    Should be able to connect to a server, disconnect from it, reconnect, then quit.

    ------------------

    Color the commands nicely so errors are colored, commands are colored,
    output from the game log is colored and so on.

    Put these color configurations inside config json files, eg. data/config/Console.json

    ------------------

    Add a log as well, output to client.log on server.log with append.

    Make sure that when a new instance of the program runs it puts a new
    header in there, or =========================== or something similar.

    ------------------

    Learn how to use chef/knife to setup the linux server properly with all
    the stuff I want automatically, vs. manually configuring it. eg. git,
    GCC and all that.

    Get the server loop setup properly. Server needs to update game and then sleep
    until time has elapsed for next frame. I think I have this code available
    from previous projects. Resurrect it.

    Find a nifty way with scripts to update the server on request, or automatically
    when git is checked in.

    Get the client/server workflow really tight!

    ------------------------------

    Add concept of console commands and console variables

    Hook up concept of client and server side console commands / convars

    Work out how to transmit these to the client on initial connect
    and then on each change.
