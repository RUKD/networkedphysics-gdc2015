DONE:

    Implement jitter buffer

    Store the packet pointer and delete it? Or copy the data?

    The data is pretty small. Just copy. Safer.

    Hacked up StateJitterBuffer copied from interpolation buffer.

TODO:

    Work out what needs to be done to implement delay jitter buffer.

    Really shouldn't be that hard, just a cut down version of interp
    without any of the hard interp stuff!!!

    Add code so the sim doesn't run on the right until the first packet comes in.

    Set remote input to input in packet.

    Set right side time to frame # in packet (does it need to be sent or can it be inferred from sequence?)

    I think it can be inferred from sequence. Big win.

    Push cube state to right side sim

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Output the data set and optimize the encoding (single var most likely).

    Maybe try multiple var two-level encoding?

    Encode position relative to center quantized integer point.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Actually implement serialize measure before cube packet write, so cubes
    perfectly fit into the allowed # of bytes and we hit requested bandwidth
    exactly.

    Make sure serialize measure considers center point for position compression

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement error reduction for position (smoothing)

    Implement error reduction for orientation (smoothing)

    Maybe demonstrate difference between local space smoothing (error reduction)
    vs. lagging world space smoothing (following spring...)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Might be cool to have a fake lag switch when you press a button,
    eg. no packets come through for one second.

    Or a mode that every few seconds lets no packets in for one second.

    Will be a cool visual demonstration of how the stateful sync works,
    and recovers from errors (like errors in a video stream...)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write stateful synchronization article

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write conclusion article (pros/cons of each technique) ---> SHORT

    Need this because I need the arc of conclusion for the GDC talk.

        1. The simulation

        2. Deterministic lockstep

        3. Snapshots and interpolation

            *** snapshot compression worked example ***

        4. Stateful synchronization

        5. Conclusion: Pros/cons

        6. Question time: latency hiding, client/server, implementation details etc.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Make a list of diagrams that need to be created.

    Sketch out the diagrams roughly with pencil/paper.

    Once the basic outline is working hand over to Chantel to create the diagrams w. illustrator.

    Finish slides for GDC.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement javascript to pause video when it is not currently visible
