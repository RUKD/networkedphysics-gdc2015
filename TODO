TODO:

    ----------------------------------

    Pass in lighting uniforms for rendering.

    Implement different rendering for white and black stones via uniforms.

    Alternatively, implement black vs. white stones as per-instance data.

    This makes more sense because I'm going to want to vary this data per-instance
    to do the gradient between roughness / metal for the stones with PBR.

    ----------------------------------

    Continue studying PBR documents collected.

    There is a lot to go through.

    Identify areas where my math is weak and work to study those parts.

    ----------------------------------

    Aim to get a grid of stones showing a gradient of different PBR settings

    ----------------------------------

    Research raytracing signed distance fields for shadows

    ----------------------------------
