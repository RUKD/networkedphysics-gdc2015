TODO:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    On left side buffer snapshots indexed by sequence #

    Left side keep track of most recent ack from right side in sequence #

    Can probably do this just with a sliding window, as I always want to
    buffer all snapshots, and I always want to remove anything older than
    the ack.

    In this case I think I need to ack sequence - 1, because I want to
    retain the ack sequence for delta encoding.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right side keep track of most recent snapshot sequence # received
    (I believe the sequence buffer does this for us...)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now when sending snapshots from left -> right, encode relative to base 
    snapshot # (pass base # and pointer to snapshot buffer into packet...)

    On serialize write, compare each object against base.

    If object is identical write one bit 0 indicating it has not changed.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Widen out the sliding window to 256 entries so I have something to render

    Adjust code so the # of entries for bandwidth average is specified, eg. 64.

    Then I need to take only the most recent n in the window for avg. bandwidth calc,
    while having the history for say 256 or 512 for rendering packet size histogram.

    Visualize graph of packet in light blue, one vertical line per-packet.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Verify bandwidth spikes initially with delta encoding but hits steady state

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Next, do the math on object ids...

    Cost of indexing only the changed set of objects vs. 900 bits for yes/no.

    Write function to determine which approach is the best encoding,
    given the # of different cubes, vs. the # of total cubes.

    Extend the serialize function to use this encoding.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Next sort the cubes in order of id.

    Now write the cubes using a variable bit encoding for delta id.

    Is this effective?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now encode position relative to previous position

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Encode orientation relative to previous orientation

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Encode linear velocity relative to previous linear velocity
