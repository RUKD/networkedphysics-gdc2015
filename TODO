TODO:

    Implement network interface to send and receive packets.

    Just do it simple, eg. sendto/recvfrom but make sure IPv6 ready.

    Should be able to pass a resolver interface to the network interface, which it will use
    to take name strings to addresses if passed in. Can also send packets to addresses directly!

    First, implement the network interface simply with non-blocking sockets running on the main
    thread. 

    Next investigate other methods for sending and receiving packets, especially running
    packet encode and decode on separate worker threads (assume packet encode/decode can be expensive)
