DONE:

    Separate out compression from delta

    This way there is not an unreasonable amount of compression modes and it's not confusing.

TODO:

    Remove delta code from compression demo

    ---------------------------

    Need to retune relative position and orientation compression for 100ms latency.

    Previously was delta encoding from only a few frames ago, hence the small levels were really helping.

    Really need to perform calculations for the average position difference min/max etc.

    Need the distribution of position delta, and orientation delta (in radians)

    Need the distribution of the change in 100ms so I can plan a strategy...

    If the distribution is such that it is large on average, as a % of the total space it's not worth it (eg. orientation)
