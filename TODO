TODO:

    ----------------------------------

    Consensus seems to be that I should convert to linear colorspace now before going any further.

    Research how to work in linear space and then convert to sRGB at the end with tonemapping.

    Also, should my font textures be sRGB or linear space? Which are they? Linear I assume?

    Study that article/GDC talk that Wolfgang recommended to understand what should be linear
    and what should be in sRGB.

    Study tonemapping.

    ----------------------------------

    Reread Seb Legarde stuff again start to finish.

    Dig in a bit deeper into the source material (especially Naty's siggraph talks)
    and understand the math and physical reasoning behind it.

    Start here:

    ----------------------------------

    Continue studying trip through the graphics pipeline.

    ----------------------------------

    Identify areas where my math is weak and work to study those parts.

    Khan Academy? Probably the best bet to start.

    Get a desk so I can study.

    ----------------------------------

    Get go board rendering working

    ----------------------------------

    Render skybox and then in-game, render a cubemap from the center of a stone (size 35?)

    Make sure this cubemap is captured in HDR, eg. pre-tonemapping.

    This cubemap can then be input as

    Research raytracing signed distance fields for shadows
