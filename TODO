TODO:

    ---------------------------

    Separate out compression from delta

    This way there is not an unreasonable amount of compression modes and it's not confusing.

    ---------------------------

    Need to retune relative position and orientation compression for 100ms latency.

    Previously was delta encoding from only a few frames ago, hence the small levels were really helping.

    Really need to perform calculations for the average position difference min/max etc.

    Need the distribution of position delta, and orientation delta (in radians)

    Need the distribution of the change in 100ms so I can plan a strategy...

    If the distribution is such that it is large on average, as a % of the total space it's not worth it (eg. orientation)

    ---------------------------

    Add an adjustable tightness factor to bandwidth and adjust so 20pps
    updates at roughly the same rate of bandwidth adjustment as 60pps.

    Probably going to go with tightness hand - tuned.

    Get 20pps option working with linear interpolation

    ---------------------------

    Need to add quantized linear velocity to quantized cube state, and for demos
    that don't send the linear velocity need to make sure it is cleared always
    so operator == still works.

    Implement 20pps version of simulation with delta encoded linear velocity

    Should be signifinantly reduced bandwidth. I would hope sub 100kbps.

    ---------------------------

    Implement 3 snapshots per-packet redundant version with relative encoding

    Start with the oldest snapshot and encode the two next ones, this way
    the start snapshot is closer to the baseline.

    Then reduce playout delay buffer to 66ms.

    Even with 10% packet loss this should work fine with the small playout delay.

    In effect, we have traded a bit of extra bandwidth to compensate for packet loss,
    reducing the amount of playout delay buffer that is required (without the redundant sends,
    playout delay is used to compensate for packet loss...)
