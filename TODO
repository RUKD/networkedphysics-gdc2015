    Now need to back port to Mac OS X and take stock.

    First step should be to remove C++11 crap. Strip it out.

    --------

    Branch off now and cut down, remove virtual go stuff, tools etc.

    Zip up source code.

    Give supporters and updated version of the GDC 2015 example source code.
