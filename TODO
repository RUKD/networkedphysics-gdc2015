    Disabled font tool.

TODO:

    --------------

    Bug. I fucked up the stencil shadows with a change I made to fix warnings. Dumbass.

    Do some more work to build warning free. Get it done.

    Convert back to release and make sure it works. For tests I need to convert from 'CORE_ASSERT' to 'check' macro

    Bonus points, port to windows. Give supporters and updated version of the GDC 2015 example source code.
