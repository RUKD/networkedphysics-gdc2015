DONE:

    Final pass over state synchronization ready for publish.

    Tell patreon supporters what I'm up to.

    Fix various bugs in state synchronization demo.

    Sketch out state sync demo functions to support uncompressed and compressed

    Templatize jitter buffer, needs to support both compressed and uncompressed state updates.

    Convert all the other bits that need uncompressed state updates.

    Implement uncompressed state sync mode.

TODO:

    --------------------------

    *** FIX THE AT REST HANDLING ***

    I note that the "AtRest" function is approximate, and really is not if the object is actually at rest according to simulation.

    You really want to get this to make sure the solver runs the same way for the extrapolation

    To make the at rest sync actually correct, not only do you need to send the at rest flag,
    but you also need to send frames until at rest for objects that are not at rest.

    Typically frames until at rest will be either maximum, or zero for truly at rest objects.

    Do I really want to go down this far in the article? Honestly, it's probably appropriate.

    --------------------------

    Hook up compressed state sync mode (not quantized)

    Hook up quantized state sync mode (quantize both sides)

    Split apart smoothing and adaptive smoothing modes

    Ready to record videos.

    --------------------------

    Record videos for state synchronization article:

        1. State synchronization uncompressed (basic stuff)

        2. Video showing popping due to not quantizing state in remote view

        3. Video showing quantize on both sides

        4. Video showing smoothing looking good, but too slow with with large jumps

        5. Video showing better smoothing with large jumps (adaptive according to distance)

        6. Lazy update of grey cubes

    -------------------------

    Add note to quantize on both sides exactly what that means. Each frame before physics simulation
    quantize all the physics state exactly as it would be sent over the network.

    Switch article to get "easy win" of at rest flag -> implied zero velocity/angvel before quantize.

    There is really no reason to ever send lin/ang vel when at rest, even when uncompressed. It's dumb!

    -------------------------

    Write "Conclusion to Part One" article with pros/cons of each approach
    and leader into part two article (paid) behind patreon.

    -------------------------
        
    Publish new article. This is intended as a drive to new patreon supporters because
    it must link to the conclusion to part 1 which drives people to the patreon page.

    Do not publish until the conclusion to pt 1 is written!
