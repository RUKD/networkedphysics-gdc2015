DONE:

TODO:

    Get gouraud shading working for the go stone with per-instance color and shading settings.

    Setup go stones with black and white checker board to be rendered.

    Implement a feature selection for the shader so I can switch at runtime between
    rendering normal visualization and rendering the gouraud shading.

    ----------------------------------

    Continue studying PBR documents collected.

    There is a lot to go through.

    Identify areas where my math is weak and work to study those parts.

    ----------------------------------

    Aim to get a grid of stones showing a gradient of different PBR settings

    ----------------------------------

    Research raytracing signed distance fields for shadows
