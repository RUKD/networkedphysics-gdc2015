DONE:

TODO:

    Each frame before simulate pull all state from simulation, quantize it, clamp position, linear velocity, angular velocity.

    This quantized state is where the cube state that fills the packet with n most important comes from.

    Then push this quantized state back to simulation and run sim frame.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Determine if precision needs to be higher for quantize.

    Hopefully not, but if it does some structural changes need to be made.


    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement priority bubble up, pull, push.

    Send packet from left to right containing cube state.

    When this packet arrives print to make sure it's being received.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement jitter buffer. Just delay just enough to handle jitter (just over two frames)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement push to sim from jitter buffer.

    Make sure when pushing that the correct time for that frame is being set
    from the jitter buffer, you are not guaranteed to receive first packet.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Encode position relative to center quantized integer point. smallest 3 orientation. 

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement error reduction for position (smoothing)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement error reduction for orientation (smoothing)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Might be cool to have a fake lag switch when you press a button,
    eg. no packets come through for one second.

    Will be a cool visual demonstration of how the stateful sync works,
    and recovers from errors (like errors in a video stream...)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write stateful synchronization article

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write conclusion article (pros/cons of each technique) ---> SHORT

    Need this because I need the arc of conclusion for the GDC talk.

        1. The simulation

        2. Deterministic lockstep

        3. Snapshots and interpolation (plus compression)

        4. Stateful synchronization

        5. Conclusion: Pros/cons of each approach

        6. Good question time ideally: latency hiding, client/server, implementation details etc.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Make a list of diagrams that need to be created.

    Sketch out the diagrams roughly with pencil/paper.

    Once the basic outline is working hand over to Chantel to create the diagrams w. illustrator.

    Finish slides for GDC.

    Implement javascript to pause video when it is not currently visible
