TODO:

    ------------------

    Get the server loop setup properly. Server needs to update game and then sleep
    until time has elapsed for next frame. I think I have this code available
    from previous projects. Resurrect it.

    Setup an instance on Amazon. Initially, while I don't have much to run make
    it a micro instance, but eventually I'm probably going to want a high CPU
    instance to run the physics simulation.

    ------------------------------

    Get some font rendering stuff working in OpenGL.

    Use "fonts for code" from here: http://input.fontbureau.com

    Implement a quake style console.

    Redirect stdout and stderr output to the console.

    ------------------------------

    Add concept of console commands and console variables

    Hook up concept of client and server side console commands / convars

    Work out how to transmit these to the client on initial connect
    and then on each change.

    ------------------------------

NOTES:

    ---------------------------

    It's annoying and complicated to create a game server.

    It's really nice that it's completely configurable,
    but the config being passed in to the constructor makes it
    difficult to create a derived class that just creates how
    it wants to.

    Maybe an init method would be a better idea? Even if it's internal...

    I really want the game client and server to be self contained, eg. own all objects they use

    ---------------------------

    I want the client to have callbacks for pretty much everything that happens, eg. 
    te be able to get callbacks on client connect, disconnect, to be able to override
    packet receives (eg. process more packet types) and so on.

    ---------------------------

    The network simulator is coded in such a way that it is annoying to use
    for a real application. I don't want it to randomly cycle between settings
    automatically. I want the user to be able to choose between a series of presets.

    ---------------------------

    It's really annoying not being able to create an address passing in dynamic port,
    eg. Address( "::1", ServerPort ) should be a thing.
    
    ---------------------------

    Client connect takes over 1 second. Optimize!
