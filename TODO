DONE:

    Implement the best position strategy (5-9-5-9)

    And then extend it to support the extra compression for not small components

    Split out serialize relative position function so it's reusable.

    Split out serialize orientation function so it will be reusable when written. Dummy out for now w. absolute

    Update the optimize position ruby script to consider this and make sure 5-9-5-9 is still the best.

    Yes it's still the best.

    Best optimized position is 8.64083585062093 bits per-position component. That's fucking incredible!

    Lock it down and move on!

    Implement best orientation strategy (smallest 3 with 5 bits delta, eg. +/- 15), and large (+/-255)

TODO:

    Extend to support extra range for not small components.

    Break out to optimize_smallest_three.rb

    Apply same optimization strategy for smallest three two-level (small/large bits)

    Verify the bit ranges are optimal.

    Gather statistics about it. eg. avg. bits per-orientation

    Lock it down and move on!
