TODO:

    Get a 10HZ version running with linear velocity

    This version requires adding the linear velocity to the quantized cube state

    I have to update the == operator to handle the linear velocity comparison

    I'd also like the linear velocity to be an integer quantized value like position

    If linear velocity is not being used, it needs to be cleared to (0,0,0)

    This way the non-hermite interpolation versions that don't use it will
    still work with == operator comparisons for delta compression.

    Drop to 10HZ and tune the linear velocity precision to the lowest power
    of two that avoids seeing compression artifacts @ 10HZ.

    This is the "end result" of all the compression effort.

    Should be a ridiculously low value of kbps now... put a fork in it!

    Debug why the interpolation buffer is misbehaving @ 60pps.
