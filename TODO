DONE:

    Upgrade to premake5

    Some problem with 'find' in clean. Already solved in my other premakes.

    Brought across clean hack from yojimbo

    Some problems including freetype headers... wtf

    Verified that cube demos run now.

    Disabled font tool.

    Generate a cubes dataset for Mark B. Reynolds (uncompressed, non-quantized...)

    Done! Sending off!

    Update copyright and licence to The Network Protocol Company, Inc. BSD 3-Clause.

    Do some more work to build warning free. Get it done.

    Convert back to release and make sure it works. For tests I need to convert from 'CORE_ASSERT' to 'check' macro

    Bug. I fucked up the stencil shadows with a change I made to fix warnings... fix it!

    Just an accidental deletion of a line. Fixed now.

TODO:

    Port to windows. 

    Might need to include a version of glfw for windows.
