DONE:

TODO:

    Each frame before simulate pull all state from simulation, quantize it, clamp position, linear velocity, angular velocity.

    From this quantized state you can then fill packet with n most important.

    Then push this quantized state back to simulation and run sim frame.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Move generally useful serialization stuff into somewhere that is generally useful.

    May need to make various precision inputs to functions rather than static const, eg.
    position resolution *may* need to be higher for quantized position state.

    Hopefully not though.

    Implement jitter buffer. Just delay just enough to handle jitter (just over two frames)

    Implement priority bubble up, pull, push.

    Send packet from left to right containing cube state.

    Encode position relative to center quantized integer point. smallest 3 orientation. 

    Quantize and bound linear/angular velocity.

    Index 10 bits. Too sparse to optimize with relative.

    Implement error reduction for position (smoothing)

    Implement error reduction for orientation (smoothing)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Might be cool to have a fake lag switch when you press a button,
    eg. no packets come through for one second.

    Will be a cool visual demonstration of how the stateful sync works,
    and recovers from errors (like errors in a video stream...)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write stateful synchronization article

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write conclusion article (pros/cons of each technique) ---> SHORT

    Need this because I need the arc of conclusion for the GDC talk.

        1. The simulation

        2. Deterministic lockstep

        3. Snapshots and interpolation (plus compression)

        4. Stateful synchronization

        5. Conclusion: Pros/cons of each approach

        6. Good question time ideally: latency hiding, client/server, implementation details etc.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Make a list of diagrams that need to be created.

    Sketch out the diagrams roughly with pencil/paper.

    Once the basic outline is working hand over to Chantel to create the diagrams w. illustrator.

    Finish slides for GDC.

    Implement javascript to pause video when it is not currently visible
