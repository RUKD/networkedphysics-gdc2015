    Write out data files: "orientation_data.txt", "position_data.txt" etc.

TODO:

    Start analysis on relative quaternion

    It seems that if there is a small delta xyz, it is guaranteed that there is a large w.

    This is a good thing! For small delta xyz we can always rely on w being large
    and being able to be inferred from the xyz components of the quaternion.













    Start analysis on the position.

    Answer the question, which # of bits is the best for compression?

    To do this, need to know how many bits for uncompressed.

    Also, answer the question if its better to individually do small value
    flags per x,y,z component, or if its best to group them together
