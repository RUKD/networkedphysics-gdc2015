DONE:

TODO:

    It still has some bugs, eg. not exactly reproducing the orientation (why?)

    Also, it seems that it might be possible to make it a bit more accurate,

    At minimum, use the bits perfectly for compressing the vector (eg. specify # of bits)

    First fix it so it reproduces the correct angle.

    Then if this is possible, try to optimize it -- perhaps non-linear, eg. more error
    for larger rotations or something like that?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Simplify existing serialization code. It's getting a bit complex!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement relative indices on top of all other optimizations

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Need some sort of bandwidth statistics split up into position, orientation, indices etc.

    Ready to write "Snapshot Compression" article
