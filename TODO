TODO:

    Need a way to access cube data per-simulation to copy it into the snapshot packet.

    Each frame grab the cube state and send a packet.

    On packet receive, compare sequence number and if more recent than previous (or if first...)

    If sequence number is more recent, push it to simulation and update recv_sequence #

    -------------------------------------------

    Standardized virtual shutdown method for all demos

    -------------------------------------------
    
    Standardize delete as resetting the demo (eg. shutdown/initialize),
    which basically means reset the demo but keep the same mode.

    Escape means completely reload the demo, which means, reset to default mode.

    -------------------------------------------

    Should be a console command, eg. mode 1, mode 2 etc.

    -------------------------------------------

    Modes should have descriptions. 

    These descriptions should be shown somewhere briefly when the mode change
    is initiated via console command or direct keyboard press, eg: 1,2,3,4,5
    otherwise it can get difficult to track what mode you're in.

    -------------------------------------------

    Network simulator could have a flag set to actually perform the serialization of packets.

    Should be on by default.

    Clean up code that is manually serializing packets. 

    Let the network simulation do it for us instead. Less code!

    -------------------------------------------

    Concept of demos having a "mode". Mode is selected via 1,2,3,4,5 etc.

    Default mode can be specified on command line.

    Escape resets to default mode.

    Doing this across all demos provides a nice way to have different states per-demo
    that is standard across all demos, eg. constant interface, less work.

    -------------------------------------------

    Would be great to be able to quickly define a packet factory with macros.

    It's all very boilerplate. Annoying to cut & paste code it each time.

    Pass over all packet factories and convert to use the macros!

    -------------------------------------------

    Would be really cool to have a bunch of presets for network conditions, for cubes demos:

        1. perfect
        2. 50ms round trip, 1% packet loss
        3. 100ms round trip, 2% packet loss
        4. 250ms round trip, 5% packet loss
        5. 500ms round trip, 10% packet loss
        6. 1000ms round trip, 25% packet loss
        7. 2000ms round trip, 50% packet loss

    And so on.

    Unfortunately, the TCP demo starts behaving crazy after a certain amount of loss,
    such that it tends to get behind and never catches, up so it's not the best test case.

    --------------------------------------------

    Seems to work going from non-TCP to TCP mode.

    But the other way breaks all packets getting through. Why?

    ^------- Doesn't matter. Do the reset whenever a TCP vs. non-TCP mode switch is made. Easy.

    Setup a struct defining the current mode in lockstep demo: LockstepModeConfig m_mode_config

    Static definition for descriptions and lockstep mode configs.

    --------------------------------------------

    While determinism is enabled/disabled dynamically, flash "non-determinstic!" over the screen somehere?
