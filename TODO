DONE:

    I would like the color tightness to grey to be slower,
    but I want to keep the tight color going to red the same.

    Tuned the wobble and bob a bit while hovering.

TODO:

    *** POLISH ***

    When I am in a katamari ball and I press SPACE I want to burst
    out of it and go up high. Right now it is very unsatisfying!

    ^--- solve by extra force proportional to velocity, eg. if
    velocity is below a certain amount of up (faded out), add extra
    up force, this should apply extra up force to remove the weight
    of the other stones that are pushing down on you.

    When I bounce on the ground, I would like there to be a region,
    say 1-2m worth, where I have the same consistent launch up force
    vs. right now where it feels there is a small 25cm area where I 
    get a big force up.

    When I accelerate the ball left/right I would like it to do so
    a bit faster initially when I am still, eg. an amount of extra force
    proportional to the dot of my speed in the direction I want to go.

    The circle of activation looks weird. Would probably look better
    if it were based on manhattan distance, eg. a square of activation?

    When I roll really quickly I want the cubes I splash through to be
    pushed forward with some force proportional to my linear velocity,
    eg. if linear velocity is above some threshold, add a force proportional
    to that speed in the direction of motion to push or splash cubes forward.

    ----------------------------------

    Convert DDS loading to use nvImage to load HDR uffizi cubemap.

    Work on exposure and get the scene looking good with HDR, may need to bump up direct light intensity?

    ----------------------------------

    Get roughness working with this HDR cubemap, eg. use roughness to index the mip chain.

    Look into a normalized BRDF function that accepts roughness, eg. microfacet model.

    ----------------------------------

    Get fresnel working so some reflection is visible even on the diffuse stone and more 
    reflection is visible at grazing angles (quite important for realistic go stone visuals)

    ----------------------------------

    Reread Seb Legarde stuff again start to finish.

    http://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/hello-world/

    Dig in a bit deeper into the source material (especially Naty's siggraph talks)
    and understand the math and physical reasoning behind it.

    Start here:

    Continue studying trip through the graphics pipeline.

    ----------------------------------

    Identify areas where my math is weak and work to study those parts.

    Khan Academy? Probably the best bet to start.

    Get a desk so I can study.

    ----------------------------------

    Get go board rendering working

    ----------------------------------

    Render skybox and then in-game, render a cubemap from the center of a stone (size 35?)

    Make sure this cubemap is captured in HDR, eg. pre-tonemapping.

    This cubemap can then be input into CubeMapGen or cmft to get a correct radiance 
    and irradiance cubemap including the go board in the scene, eg. reflected color of the wood.
