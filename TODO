DONE:

    Measure position deltas in units and accumulate in static buffer. 

    Print out and capture to file.

    Do the same for smallest three a,b,c

    Take quaternion and convert to 10 bit precision and calculate deta (4 component)

TODO:

    ---------------------------

    Calculate delta of axis * angle (3 component), quantized to 1024

    ---------------------------

    Calculate the relative quaternion and calculate the delta of x,y,z from zero, and w from 1.0 (4 component)

    ---------------------------

    Adjust smallest 3 delta such that:

        1. it ignores differences when largest value is changed
        2. I can measure % of largest value changing vs. not
        3. I am ensured that both quaternions are in the same quadrant first (eg. go out to quat, back off, dot, re-encode...)

    ---------------------------

    Post process data according to power of two buckets and print out % that is covered by that bucket

    Now determine power of two buckets in which all components are <= bounds, eg. % inside inside this bucket.

    ---------------------------
