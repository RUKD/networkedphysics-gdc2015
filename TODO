DONE:

    Set up separate client and server programs in game.

    -DCLIENT on client to separate client and server.

    This is the easiest way to create a client/server split.

TODO:

    Get the server loop setup. Server needs to update game and then sleep
    until time has elapsed for next frame. I think I have this code available
    from previous projects. Resurrect it.

    Setup an instance on Amazon. Initially, while I don't have much to run make
    it a micro instance, but eventually I'm probably going to want a high CPU
    instance to run the physics simulation.

    Get the client setup and connecting to server (initially hardcoded, but... 
    eventually setup params and a UI, quake console "connect servername", "disconnect" etc.

    Need to set up a way to compile a source file in client and server context, eg.
    compile as client should be a new hotkey setup in sublime, or I can switch between
    client and server context inside sublime (different build systems?)
