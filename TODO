DONE:

    Implement relative position

    Doesn't seem to be getting much improvement

    Is something wrong?!

    Lots is going wrong.

    The quantization from compressed floats is causing positions equality checks
    to not function, and I think it is also causing the incorrect ix,iy,iz.

    The solution here is to quantize the entire simulation before grabbing
    the snapshot, eg. have a new snapshot called "QuantizedSnapshot" which
    contains "QuantizedCubeState" in which positions are stored as integers.

    This way there can be no floating point issues when converting in/out
    of grid, and the grids are also perfectly efficient in terms of powers
    of two, eg. 4096 units per-grid or whatever.

    This is the next thing that must be done.

    What is the nearest power of two unit (per-meter) that obtains 0.001 precision for position?

    1/256 = 0.003

    1/512 = 0.0019

    1/1024 = 0.00097 (winner)

    Start here.

    Position units are 1024 units per-meter.

TODO:

    Implement quantized snapshot.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement relative orientation

    Can relative orientation be efficient?

    How to encode it?

    Axis-angle?

    How close does

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement relative indices on top of all other optimizations

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Need some sort of bandwidth statistics split up into position, orientation, indices etc.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write code to output bandwidth as CSV so I can graph it. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write code code to output position delta and orientation delta
    (eg. largest component change) as a histogram so again I can graph it.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ready to write "Snapshot Compression" article
