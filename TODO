    I need to get an environment map and run it through AMD CubeMapGen

    This tool creates a cubemap with mip levels that have different blurs.

    The blurs are then sampled with trilinear interpolation using the roughness 
    parameter as an index between mip levels.

    This tools runs in windows so I should just run it in my emulated Win8
    and then take the output files and put inside data so they can be loaded.

    Adding new cubemaps should be rare so this is OK.

    ----------------------------------

    Research how to work in linear space and then convert to RGB at the end with tonemapping.

    ----------------------------------

    Continue studying trip through the graphics pipeline.

    ----------------------------------

    Identify areas where my math is weak and work to study those parts.

    ----------------------------------

    Research raytracing signed distance fields for shadows
