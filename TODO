    Think through more interpolation

    What's the best way to buffer packets and interpolate?

    It's basically a playout delay buffer.

    It needs to be smart enough not to allow any late snapshot in the buffer
    that would affect current interpolation, eg. once you start interpolating 
    from A -> C you can't allow B to pop up and affect that.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement the interpolation buffer

    (It's basically got to be a sliding window with holes)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Get linear interpolation working @ 10pps

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Get hermite interpolation working @ 10pps

    Note: Need to send linear and angular velocity for this one!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    At this point start investigating compression approaches

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    First obvious win is if the object is at rest, send one bit
    and don't send lin/ang velocity.

    Many objects are at rest. This is a big win.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Next compress orientation. It's the biggest (16 bytes).

    Can get it down to 32 bytes pretty easily.

    Smallest three.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Compress linear and angular velocity.

    Quantize them and 
    




    -------------------------------------------

    Network simulator could have a flag set to actually perform the serialization of packets.

    Should be on by default.

    Clean up code that is manually serializing packets. 

    Let the network simulation do it for us instead. Less code!

    -------------------------------------------

    Would be great to be able to quickly define a packet factory with macros.

    It's all very boilerplate. Annoying to cut & paste code it each time.

    Pass over all packet factories and convert to use the macros!
