DONE:

    Record videos for state synchronization article:

        1. State synchronization uncompressed (basic stuff)      <--- should already look pretty much perfect

        2. Video showing popping due to not quantizing state in remote view        

            ^---------- will need to construct a large stack of objects to see the popping

            ^---------- may need to drop to lower precision to emphasize the popping

        3. Video showing quantize on both sides                  <--- should look perfect again.

        4. Video showing smoothing too slow with with large jumps

TODO:

        5. Video showing better smoothing with large jumps (adaptive according to distance)

        6. Lazy update of grey cubes (probably best demonstrated in packet loss mode)      

            ^--------- (demonstrate by pushing cubes and letting them come to rest with sync disabled, then turning sync on = lazy updates)

    -------------------------

    Convert videos to web formats (need to dig up commands from CHANGES file)

    -------------------------

    Add note to quantize on both sides exactly what that means. Each frame before physics simulation
    quantize all the physics state exactly as it would be sent over the network.

    Switch article to get "easy win" of at rest flag -> implied zero velocity/angvel before quantize.

    There is really no reason to ever send lin/ang vel when at rest, even when uncompressed. It's dumb!

    -------------------------

    Article should describe smoothing, desire smooth (slow) reduction for small pops, and fast corrections
    for large jumps (because it looks silly to draw it out)

    Smooth and snappy at the same time? How?

    Adaptive smoothing.

    -------------------------

    Write "Conclusion to Part One" article with pros/cons of each approach
    and leader into part two article (paid) behind patreon.

    -------------------------

    Copy across updated SyncDemo.cpp code and Snapshot.h to the release branch

    Make sure to not let across any "The Network Protocol Company" copyright notices.

    -------------------------
        
    Publish new article. This is intended as a drive to new patreon supporters because
    it must link to the conclusion to part 1 which drives people to the patreon page.

    Do not publish until the conclusion to pt 1 is written!
