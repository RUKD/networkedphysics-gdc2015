    Make a list of diagrams that need to be created.

    Sketch out the diagrams roughly with pencil/paper.

    Once the basic outline is working hand over to Chantel to create the diagrams w. illustrator.

    Now I can work in parallel.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Need to move on to stateful synchronization implementation.

    Get the code working. 

    Implement priority bubble up. 

    Encode position relative to center quantized integer point. smallest 3 orientation. 

    Quantize and bound linear/angular velocity.

    Index 10 bits. Too sparse to optimize with relative.

    Can't use delta encoding. Or at least, would be really complex, you have to specify base
    per-object, not per-snapshot as not all objects are included in snapshot, and 1 bit for
    no base. Possible. Might we worth it. Punting.

    Instead... send less frequently. Come up with heuristics. 

    Use the sim on the right side to send less data, eg. space out object updates.

    Maybe washing machine with hash (eg. detect wrong or changed, prioritize resend higher...)

    Nice distance based function from Tony. x / (x + 1 ) or something?

    Error reduction for position.

    Error reduction for orientation.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write stateful synchronization article

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write conclusion article (pros/cons of each technique) ---> SHORT

    Need this because I need the arc of conclusion for the GDC talk.

        1. The simulation

        2. Deterministic lockstep

        3. Snapshots and interpolation (plus compression)

        4. Stateful synchronization

        5. Conclusion: Pros/cons of each approach

        6. Good question time ideally: latency hiding, client/server, implementation details etc.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Generate a bunch of statistics, graphs, diagrams and so on to create slides.

    Finish slides for GDC.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is going to be very hard to finish this week but it *must* be finished this week.
