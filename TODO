DONE:

    Hook up compressed quaternion to the quantized cube state.

    Tried to do relative orientation with this, but it needs a really high
    precision float per-component (0.0001), eg. 10 bits per-component to
    give a good result.

    Could try non-linear quantization with this, but first, I will try
    something simpler -- try to delta the smallest three representation
    directly.

    Explore if it is best to encode position/quat orientation with
    bits per-component, vs. one bit for range. Probably is!

    Tried it. Not really getting a lot of compression.

    At this point seems the best bet is to more roughly compress the orientation
    when the cubes are rotating quickly (not noticeable) and compress them fine
    when the rotation is small.

    The rough compression could be very rough, eg. 8X rougher

    Doing this tends to save 20-30kbps at the top end while blowing cubes.

    But, it seems to also add jitter to cubes while in the katamari.

TODO:

    Try this option:

    1. Approximate the angular velocity from the two previous snapshots

    2.

    Implement relative indices on top of all other optimizations

    Need some sort of bandwidth statistics split up into position, orientation, indices etc.
