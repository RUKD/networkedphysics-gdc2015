DONE:

    Actually attempt to render the cubes!

    Setup light position as a uniform.

    Setup per-instance data before rendering.

    Upload per-instance data to the instance buffer.

    Kick off the instanced draw call!

    Stupid OpenGL is giving me an invalid operation post draw call. WTF... =p

    Was just that IBO was not bound to VAO.

TODO:

    Get the cubes rendering... pass in the correct matrices and so forth.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Retune the simulation now that I have a bit more CPU power,
    eg. try more iterations and so on. Try to make sure stacks
    of cubes are stable and come to rest.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Get the activation circle rendering

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Get shadows rendering

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Prep talk outline

    Prep talk slides

    --------------------------------------------------------------












    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Explore various different interpolation strategies to use for 2D linear motion.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Return to PBR rendering

    --------------------------------------------------------------


















    ----------------------------------

    Convert DDS loading to use nvImage to load HDR uffizi cubemap.

    Work on exposure and get the scene looking good with HDR, may need to bump up direct light intensity?

    ----------------------------------

    Get roughness working with this HDR cubemap, eg. use roughness to index the mip chain.

    Look into a normalized BRDF function that accepts roughness, eg. microfacet model.

    ----------------------------------

    Get fresnel working so some reflection is visible even on the diffuse stone and more 
    reflection is visible at grazing angles (quite important for realistic go stone visuals)

    ----------------------------------

    Reread Seb Legarde stuff again start to finish.

    http://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/hello-world/

    Dig in a bit deeper into the source material (especially Naty's siggraph talks)
    and understand the math and physical reasoning behind it.

    Start here:

    ----------------------------------

    Continue studying trip through the graphics pipeline.

    ----------------------------------

    Identify areas where my math is weak and work to study those parts.

    Khan Academy? Probably the best bet to start.

    Get a desk so I can study.

    ----------------------------------

    Get go board rendering working

    ----------------------------------

    Render skybox and then in-game, render a cubemap from the center of a stone (size 35?)

    Make sure this cubemap is captured in HDR, eg. pre-tonemapping.

    This cubemap can then be input into CubeMapGen or cmft to get a correct radiance 
    and irradiance cubemap including the go board in the scene, eg. reflected color of the wood.

    ----------------------------------

    Research raytracing signed distance fields for shadows
